If travelers know the policy better, they can often save money on travel insurance. Here are top simple travel health insurance tips travelers should know.

**Tip1: Understanding Travel Health Insurance Policy First**  
Travelers should read travel insurance policy before purchasing any plan, and better understand the coverage the company has offered. Every policy has few limitations such as pre-existence health conditions and age limits which must be well known to travelers unless it could be a great problem.

**Tip 2: Medical Assistance Services**  
When travelers are going to buy insurance policy, they should ask to the company if they have any assistance service for their clients. Experience shows that there are many assistance service companies which are disinterested to take to emergency calls to real doctors or nurse. But it’s not all the cases, there are some serious insurance companies which pay attention to their respected clients and provide assistance service. Though it is little bit expensive to receive calls from distance, but few companies take their responsibility because minutes can save lives.

**Tip 3: Understand the Preexisting Condition**  
Travel health insurance policy has few terms and conditions and the travelers should understand the preexisting condition clause of policy. And check these terms and conditions apply since travelers’ departure date, not while purchasing the plan. Suppose travelers buy an annual health insurance policy then these conditions apply to the departure date of every trip.

**Tip 4: Buy Health Insurance That Cover Medical Conditions**  
Travelers who take medication will not congregate with the pre-existing clause and unfortunately you will not get any coverage for such conditions. So check the insurance policy and in case you do not understand compare among different agencies which offer health insurance plan compatible with your medication.

**Tip5: Choose Affordable Deductible**  
Many travelers want to save money while purchasing insurance policy. However, there are various deductible choices in policy by which traveler can easily save money and has to provide fewer premiums.  
So choose any deductable which only you can afford. While choosing plan you see there are few policies which have greater deductibles, do not fall into that trap because greater deductable means greater price.

**Tip 6: Save Money In Multiple Trips**  
Generally insurance companies offer health insurance plan in different category such as single trip, multiple trips, individual trip, family or group plan etc., first determine that whether your trip is single or multiple in a year. If you are planning multiple trips then you need to buy annual plan rather than single plan. Annual insurance policy is comparatively less expensive, and you can save as much money as making another travel.

**Tip 7: Save Money Even In Higher Age Band**  
All know that higher age people have to give higher premium and lower age people have to give lower amount, but there is little trick to get lower premium yet you are in higher age band. It seems if your birthday will place before your trip, you have to give extra 20% – 40% premium more than earlier, but if you purchase health insurance plan and leave your country before birthday, you can save significant amount of money which you have to pay after your birthday. Even you can save money by purchasing insurance policy before birthday with lower age band.

**Tip 8: Follow Doctor’s recommendations**  
Many people often do not take drugs or medicine even their doctor recommends them because they think it might affect insurance policy. This practice is bad, though it is true but traveler should follow the doctor’s prescriptions because health is important than money. When doctor gives change in medicine, you should take unless the insurance company rejects your claim in the ground of unstable preexistence medical conditions. It would be better while getting an insurance plan provide details about your medical conditions and the medicine you are using.

**Tip 9: Inform Your Insurance Company If Trip Plan Changes**  
Many people do not inform to their insurance agency when they change in insurance plan and the most mistakes are that they forget or intentionally do not inform their departure time and arrival time. This is the worst case and most important reason to get rejected their claim. Logically why any insurance company covers you if they do not know where you are and what you are doing. They simple void you policy. So inform as soon as you are planning to change your plan r any part the plan.

**Tip 10: Show the Proofs of Departure and Arrival**  
Travel insurance companies sometimes check the proofs of your travel and sadly few people forget to keep record of their medical expenses and other costs and get rejected. There are few ways to keep record such as use credit card on the first day and last day of your trip. Some health insurance companies recommend using stamp on passport while departing from and arriving to your country.

These travel health insurance tips help travelers to purchase insurance policy properly, to get affordable health insurance, to know how to choose deductable which less premium and finally to know how to claim.
