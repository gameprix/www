<div style="text-align: justify;">**The negative side of bank mortgage insurance :** Mortgage life insurance isn’t very popular and it has more than a few detractors. For one thing, the premium payments typically remain constant even though your death benefit drops. What seemed like a bargain when you first took the insurance, and your mortgage, becomes less so as the loan balance and the insurance death benefit drop.</div><a name="more"></a>  
Another concern is that the i**nsurance benefit** will be payable to your lender upon your death, not to your dependents. That limits the desirability of having this **type of insurance**.

While it may be good to have your mortgage paid off upon your death, your dependents may have other, more pressing concerns. They will not be able to address those concerns with a mortgage life insurance policy. **read [How does mortgage life insurance work](http://bestinsurancestocks.blogspot.com/2013/02/how-does-mortgage-life-insurance-work.html)**   
 **Is it worth having?**

For most people **mortgage life insurance** shouldn’t be necessary. You can instead take the largest term life insurance policy you can afford and use part of the proceeds to payoff the mortgage on your home at your death, if that’s what you and your survivors agree upon. However your dependents will not be locked into paying off the mortgage, should they decide against doing so.

A straight **term life insurance policy** give them the **flexibility to allocate the money** wherever it’s most needed. Maybe that’s the mortgage, and maybe it’s not, but they’ll have that option.

If you don’t have a whole lot of confidence that your survivors will allocate the life insurance proceeds wisely, then mortgage life insurance can be a consideration. Since the proceeds will be allocated directly to payoff the mortgage event of your death, you will be able to know that it will happen as you wish.

Your survivors might still blow through other insurance proceeds, but at least you can know that the mortgage on a house will be paid for.
