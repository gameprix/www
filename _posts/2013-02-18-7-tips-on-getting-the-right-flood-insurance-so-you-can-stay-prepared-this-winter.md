To help you prepare for your search, please enjoy the following list of tips for finding the right flood insurance.”</span>  
  
<span style="background-color: white; color: #40454b; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;">1. Assess your Home’s Risk</span>  
<span style="background-color: white; color: #40454b; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;">A nation wide insurance company stated that one third of the flood claims they get come from homes not in a flood prone area. It’s important to consider your real risk for a flood of any kind, and how high if a risk it is. Depending on your homes propensity to flood, the policy you choose should adjust to it accordingly. You can go to the governments flood site, FloodSmart.com, to get a better idea of your homes risk for flooding as well as some estimates for price ranges you should be expecting.</span>

2. Don’t Wait  
It takes awhile to finalize the process of getting flood insurance, and if a flood occurs during that process it’s not likely that you will receive coverage. If you are considering this type of insurance, then make sure you plan to purchase it well before flood or even rain season. Unfortunately, the majority of homes in Louisiana had no flood insurance during hurricane Katrina, and government handouts only go so far. 3\. Educate Yourself on Limits  
Before signing anything, make sure you know your home well and they type of flood damage it could incur. Then carefully evaluate your flood insurance proposal and make sure you are fully covered for any and every area of concern. While some insurance companies have limits to the amount they’ll refund you for damages, some will cover your home and it’s possessions to the full extent. Do not be afraid to ask questions, express concerns, or criticize rates and limits. This is your home, life, and family you’re dealing with so it’s okay to be a little pushy to make sure you’re getting what you want when you pay for it.

4\. Ask About Rate Increases  
No one wants to think about their rates increasing in the future when they’re first taking on a new bill, but it is important to remember that your flood insurance rates could very likely rise and you will be expected to pay the difference. Luckily, now that you know this you can take a look at rate limits for each insurance company you consider, and factor them in.

5\. Preparation is Key  
The more knowledgeable and prepared you are when choosing flood insurance, the more likely you are to make the perfect choice for you. Before going in to question agents, make a list of things you’d like to ask and know. It’s easy to get flustered and forget important things when you’re talking to a smooth talking insurance agent who knows how to make a sale. Know what exactly you’d like protected from a potential flood (just the home, or all possessions or vehicles as well?) and what your budget is. Look online before going out to et a good idea for insurance rates for your area.

6\. Ask Neighbors  
Don’t be shy to ask neighbors and friends living nearby if they have flood insurance and which company they purchased it from. Make sure to ask multiple questions from overall satisfaction, to reliability and rates. The best reviews are from the customers themselves as opposed to the company trying to sell their stuff.

7\. Do Not Rely on Handouts  
Although it’s true people living in high-risk areas have the right to government aid in a natural disaster, they aid is very limited. Very limited. If you live in one of theses areas and thus think you don’t need insurance, know that you’ll receive some help but you may lose your home and possessions in the process, as the government is not likely to replace them.
