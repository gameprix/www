<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><div style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.700000762939453px; margin-bottom: 0.75em; padding: 0px;">Same goes for your retirement. If you do not lock-in money every year or every month – chances are that there would not be too much left when your source of income dies down. Thats when your medical expenses peak and your source of income has dried. Plan for it at least 20 years from that date so that there are no surprises. And don’t just keep hoping for the best!</div></div>
