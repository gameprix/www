<div style="text-align: justify;">**best insurance stock – Insurance claims from the latest Queensland floods** have already topped $27 million, as river levels continue to rise in large parts of the state. As of Monday morning, “just shy of 3000 claims” had been lodged relating to losses in Queensland, said Campbell Fuller, general manager for communications at the the Insurance Council of Australia. The total claimed losses are likely to be “well north of $40 million”, he said. “Rivers are still rising across **south-eastern Queensland**,” he said, adding that flood waters were yet to peak at Ipswich and much of Bundaberg remained underwater.
