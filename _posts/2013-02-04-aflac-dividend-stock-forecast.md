<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;">[![Aflac Dividend Stock forecast](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6DdLpld8kbY/UOcMBLIRGfI/AAAAAAAAClI/jnxN0vV2Li0/s200/Aflac+Inc+AFL+stock+prediction+2013.jpg "Aflac Dividend Stock forecast")](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6DdLpld8kbY/UOcMBLIRGfI/AAAAAAAAClI/jnxN0vV2Li0/s1600/Aflac+Inc+AFL+stock+prediction+2013.jpg)</div><div style="text-align: justify;">**Aflac Dividend Stock forecast** : Aflac Incorporated provides supplemental health and life insurance in Japan (80% of earnings) and the U.S. Products are marketed at work sites and help fill gaps in primary coverage. **Fair Value:** In calculating fair value, I consider the NPV MMA Differential Fair Value along with these four calculations of fair value, see page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description:

</div><a name="more"></a>

<div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div style="text-align: justify;">1. Avg. High Yield Price</div><div style="text-align: justify;">2. 20-Year DCF Price</div><div style="text-align: justify;">3. Avg. P/E Price</div><div style="text-align: justify;">4. Graham Number</div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div style="text-align: justify;">**AFL is trading** at a discount to 3.) and 4.) above. The stock is trading at a 16.2% discount to its calculated fair value of $61.44. AFL earned a Star in this section since it is trading at a fair value.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div style="text-align: justify;">**Dividend Analytical Data:** In this section there are three possible Stars and three key metrics, see page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description:</div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div style="text-align: justify;">1. Free Cash Flow Payout</div><div style="text-align: justify;">2. Debt To Total Capital</div><div style="text-align: justify;">3. Key Metrics</div><div style="text-align: justify;">4. Dividend Growth Rate</div><div style="text-align: justify;">5. Years of Div. Growth</div><div style="text-align: justify;">6. Rolling 4-yr Div. &gt; 15%</div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div style="text-align: justify;">AFL earned three Stars in this section for 1.), 2.) and 3.) above. A Star was earned since the Free Cash Flow payout ratio was less than 60% and there were no negative Free Cash Flows over the last 10 years. The stock earned a Star as a result of its most recent Debt to Total Capital being less than 45%. AFL earned a Star for having an acceptable score in at least two of the four Key Metrics measured. The company has paid a cash dividend to shareholders every year since 1973 and has increased its dividend payments for 30 consecutive years.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div style="text-align: justify;">**Dividend Income vs. MMA:** Why would you assume the equity risk and invest in a dividend stock if you could earn a better return in a much less risky money market account (MMA) or Treasury bond? This section compares the earning ability of this stock with a high yield MMA. Two items are considered in this section, see page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description:</div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div style="text-align: justify;">1. NPV MMA Diff.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">2. Years to &gt; MMA</div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div style="text-align: justify;">AFL earned a Star in this section for its NPV MMA Diff. of the $992. This amount is in excess of the $500 target I look for in a stock that has increased dividends as long as AFL has. The stock’s current yield of 2.6% exceeds the 2.54% estimated 20-year average MMA rate.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div style="text-align: justify;">**Memberships and Peers:** AFL is a member of the S&amp;P 500, a Dividend Aristocrat, a member of the Broad Dividend Achievers™ Index and a Dividend Champion. The company’s peer group includes: American Independence Corp. (AMIC) with a 0.0% yield, Unum Group (UNM) with a 2.3% yield and CNO Financial Group, Inc. (CNO) with a 0.8% yield.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div style="text-align: justify;">**Conclusion:** AFL earned one Star in the Fair Value section, earned three Stars in the Dividend Analytical Data section and earned one Star in the Dividend Income vs. MMA section for a total of five Stars. This quantitatively ranks AFL as a 5-Star Very Strong stock.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Using my D4L-PreScreen.xls model, I determined the **share price** would need to increase to $51.47 before AFL’s NPV MMA Differential decreased to the $500 minimum that I look for in a stock with 30 years of consecutive dividend increases. At that price the stock would yield 2.6%.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Resetting the D4L-PreScreen.xls model and solving for the dividend growth rate needed to generate the target $500 NPV MMA Differential, the calculated rate is 5.3%. This dividend growth rate is lower than the 7.9% used in this analysis, thus providing a margin of safety. AFL has a risk rating of 1.25 which classifies it as a Low risk stock.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Operating in the two largest insurance markets in the world (U.S. and Japan), AFL has built a tremendous low-cost distribution system. Focusing on supplemental insurance products, AFL consistently generate excess returns for shareholders. Consistent **earnings** has allowed the company to increase its dividend and repurchase shares.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Despite a strong business model, the AFL’s balance sheet remains stressed due to questions over some of its investments, specifically European bank hybrid bonds and European sovereign debt. The company has taken steps to de-risk its investment portfolio. This move will **likely** slow earnings growth over the next few years, but should lead to higher long-term value.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div style="text-align: justify;">AFL is currently trading at a discount versus its historical valuation. The company is trading below my calculated fair value price of $61.44. However, a recent runup in its share price has lowered the stocks yield, so for now I will wait on a more attractive entry point before adding to my position.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Disclaimer: Material presented here is for informational purposes only.
