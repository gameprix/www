So lets say, you know there is an expense which you would have to incur for your child’s higher studies, 15 years from now. So take an [insurance](http://www.myinsuranceclub.com/) plan which matures 15 years from now. It could be an aggressive investment plan or a plan which is more in debt instruments – the returns might be lower – but they are more certain for sure.</div></div>
