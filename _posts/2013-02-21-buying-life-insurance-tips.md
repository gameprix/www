<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">Life insurance<span style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 17.03125px; text-align: justify;"> serves as a protection if the insured dies. For example, if I was insured by an insurance product and die tomorrow, then the insurance companies will provide insurance money to people who I left behind.</span>

If I as the backbone of the family died, the family I leave behind will lose sources of income. If I follow the life insurance program, so that my family would leave the insurance money that can be used as a substitute for the lost revenue, at least for a while.</span>  
  
<span style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 17.03125px; text-align: justify;">Actually the rule choosing life insurance products are not much different from choosing another product:</span>

<span style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 17.03125px; text-align: justify;">From my brief survey to several friends and family members, virtually none of them are taking life insurance in accordance with the rules above. Most buying life insurance when not needed, and not take life insurance with a sufficient sum assured if needed.</span>  
<span style="background-color: white; color: #333333; display: inline; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 17.03125px; text-align: justify;">  
**Do not buy life insurance if not required**The main factors are buying life insurance dependents and obligations (e.g. debt). If someone does not have both so concerned not need life insurance.

Small children (or even newborn) do not need life insurance protection because it does not have any dependents. If the child dies, the family will grieve, but it will not adversely affect the financial condition of the family. On the contrary, precisely the family finances would improve because the number of dependents decreases. Buy life insurance child at this stage will only give free money to the insurance company.

People who already have money can become not need life insurance if you are concerned do not have dependents and do not have obligations. People without dependents and no liability to third parties do not need life insurance because if the person dies, no one feels lost revenue.

If the person is on the take-credit, consumer credit, especially now that the question already has an obligation. Thus, it is time he takes the life insurance (if credit is not equipped with credit insurance). If not, then he has the potential to incriminate relatives if something bad happened to her.

Parents of all children are independent and no longer have an obligation to the other party does not need life insurance. If the respective dies, her children will grieve, but no one will ever feel financially disadvantaged. In addition, if the parents are managing the funds properly, then the concerned should already have savings or investment return far greater value than the sum assured of life insurance.

If the parents are already having enough savings, he could cancel his life insurance before the time if the perceived value of insurance coverage is not proportional to the amount of savings. If he dies before the children independently, his children will still be a legacy in the form of these deposits.

If it does not have dependents and no longer in productive age, the elderly person needs life insurance is not, but the liquid funds in large numbers. Furthermore, in these conditions required that the product is exactly the opposite of life insurance, annuities i.e. If the life insurance provides protection if the insured dies too soon, annuities serve to provide protection if the insured is living too long. Pay life insurance premiums at this time could be a “financial disaster” for the required product is exactly the opposite of life insurance.
