<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;">[![](https://dev-git-up.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Auto-Insurance-Quote-Review.jpg)](https://dev-git-up.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Auto-Insurance-Quote-Review.jpg)</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Have you thought about asking for a free auto insurance quote on the internet? Are you concerned because you may not know anything about the company providing the quote? Are you wondering how you can find out about the reputation of the company giving you a quote, especially when it comes to paying out claims? This article will tell you how to find out about insurance companies: their financial stability and how many consumer complaints they receive, how to ask for a quote so you can compare apples to apples, and results of online quotes from eight known auto insurance companies.

How to find out the stability of an insurance company

The financial stability of a company is rated by A.M. Best and Standard &amp; Poor’s. These companies provide an independent opinion of an insurance companies ability to meet its ongoing policy and contract obligations. The A.M. Best rating is expressed as a letter grade from A++ (the highest) to D. It is recommended that you do not work with companies rating B or lower. The Standard &amp; Poor’s Ratings range from triple A (the highest) to CC. It is recommended that you do not work with companies rating lower than BBB.

How to find out individual policy holder satisfaction with an insurance company

Annually J.D. Power and Associates gathers data from policy holders nationwide regarding policy options, pricing, automated phone service and overall satisfaction, with the insurance company providing their insurance. The best rating is 5.

How to Find Out the Number of Consumer Complaints

The Department of Insurance for each state provides the general public with consumer complaint ratios. This ratio helps the consumer to identify the number of complaints per number of claims filed. A maximum of forty companies are compared. If more than forty insurance companies have complaints, only the forty companies with the most complaints will be compared. It is recommended that the complaint ratio be checked in three or more states to identify specific insurance company trends. A ratio of less than one hundred is better than average.

Ways To Lower The Premium

Most insurance companies will offer discounts for the following events:

 \* Save driving record for 3 – 5 years  
 \* No minor infractions for 3 years  
 \*Anti lock devices installed in your vehicle  
 \* No DUI for the last 3 – 5 years  
 \* License not suspended for the past 3 years  
 \*Good credit rating  
 \*Car owned rather than leased or financed  
 \*A second vehicle is also insured  
 \*Other types of insurance is also purchased from them

High risk drivers can expect to have a higher premium. Not all insurance companies will insure them. In addition when a high risk driver has an accident, the insured can expect difficulty when attempting to get the vehicle repaired using car manufactured parts. Generally auto insurance companies will pay only for the cheapest parts available.

Some insurance companies offer a lower premium for the first year as an enticement to encourage you to get your auto insurance coverage through them. So always ask about the second year premium price.
