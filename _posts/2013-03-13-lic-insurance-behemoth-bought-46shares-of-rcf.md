<div style="text-align: justify;">**LIC insurance behemoth bought 46% shares of RCF : Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) once again played the role of a white knight to rescue the share auction of Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilizers (RCF) by the government.**  
The insurance behemoth bought 46%, or 31.63 million of the 69 million shares on offer of RCF during its offer for sale (OFS) last week.</div><a name="more"></a>

<div style="text-align: justify;">This is not the first time **LIC** has bailed out a government disinvestment it had bought more than half of the bids in the ONGC and Hindustan Copper offering as well.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div style="text-align: justify;">“We have not bailed out anyone. We have examined this (RCF) issue by its own strength and then taken a decision to participate. We will examine the future issues in a similar manner and then take a call,” D K Mehrotra, chairman of LIC told Business Standard today.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div style="text-align: justify;">However, an investment banker familiar with the development said LIC was ‘asked to keep the powder dry’ for the RCF offering. “As the share-sale was not even half covered an hour before the close of bids. LIC had to put in a large-ticket application,” he said requesting anonymity.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Post the OFS, LIC now holds 6.69% stake in RCF, compared to 0.96% earlier.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div style="text-align: justify;">**Shares of RCF today** closed at Rs 43.1, about 4% below their OFS price of about Rs 45 per share.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> **Investments made by LIC** are typically for the long term but the mark-to-market losses on LIC’s investments in RCF share auction stand at Rs 6.2 crore.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The government had raised about Rs 310 crore by divesting its 12.5% holdings in RCF through the OFS route on March 8.The 69 million share auction was subscribed 1.3 times and bulk of the bids had come at a price of Rs 45.02 per share as against the minimum offer price of Rs 45 per share.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Last year, the state-owned insurance major had bought about 377 million shares (88%) of the 427 million shares that were on offer during the ONGC share-auction, which was part of last year’s disinvestment programme.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Earlier this year too during the Hindustan Copper OFS, LIC had to pick up 22.5 million shares, more than half the total 51.6 million shares auctioned.</div>
